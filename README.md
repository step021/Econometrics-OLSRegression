# OLS Regression
Simple linear regression is a statistical method that helps us understand the relationship between two variables X and y. The line of best fit is made by minimizing the error of prediction. 
This code achieves this for a Housing related data set comparing bedrooms with price and square footage of a house with price. Essentially, demonstrating the effect of these two explanatory variables on price.
